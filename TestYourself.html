                  <h4 class="card-title">1. Re-design</h4>
                  <p class="card-text"> Try to redesign an object that you use a lot in your everyday life and that is made out of plastic. 
                      The new one should not contain plastic. In addition to this, you get bonus points if you make it resistant enough so that you can make 
                      a demonstration of its use in front of your classmates. 
                      This task's purposes are to:
                       1. Make you notice how many of the objects surrounding you contain plastic
                       2. Challenge you to picture how some of them would look like if made out of different materials
                       3. Teach you that you can find plastic alternatives when recreating those objects
                       4. Hopefully, if you will be placed in a similar situation in the future, you will take sustainability into account 
                       when designing a product

                    <h4 class="card-title">2. Reuse</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">In this exercise, you are asked to go and take a look at some of the objects that you intend to throw away. If you live in an area where 
                        a good recycling system is put in place, you have probably seen in your house a special bag where items are placed for this purpose.
                        Take a look at the said bag, or clean and store somewhere separately from the rest of the disposals some of the plastic packaging 
                        items that you were going to throw away. The first step is to make a list of them.
                        This will help you become more aware of the amount of your waste. Next, try to cut/assemble them together such that you obtain an object/artistic installation. 
                        You can think of this as an arts and crafts challenge. The 2 main ideas that you will learn by the end of this are: 
                        1. Plastic can be reused/recycled, since this is most probably the exact principle on which you have had to base your design.
                        2. This reusing/recycling process can only be performed for a finite number of times. Try to imagine what else you could 
                        design if you would break down your result. There is no need to carry on with this, but the point is for you to try and estimate
                        how many similarly complex new objects you could obtain. Chances are, you will probably say "very few". Just like you have seen in this experiment,
                        the plastics that you see everywhere around you can't be infinitely recycled either. This comes down to how the polymer chains making up plastic become 
                        weaker with each melting and remodelling process.

                    <p class="card-text">For this task, you will have to design on your own one piece of clothing. 
                        Furthermore, you should be able to either wear it to school one day or take a picture of you wearing it. 
                        It can contain any materials, but it is preferable to avoid plastic, or to use plastic that otherwise 
                        you would have thrown away. Steps: 1. Deciding on a piece of clothing;
                                                           2. Coming up with an appropriate design;
                                                           3. Trying to find the right material/tools to recreate it;
                                                           4. Actually making it (eg. by learning how to sew, sticking/pinning multiple items together);
                                                           5. Trying to think of the reason why you have designed that item in a certain way (eg. what inspired you);
                                                           6. Finding ways in which it could be improved.

                      <p class="card-text">Sadly, this exercise marks the end of this program. On the plus side though, you now have the chance to go into life with all of the
                          skills and knowledge that you have acquired throught the past few months. You will thus have the opportunity to become a hero! Well, maybe not the kind 
                          that will appear in the next Marvel movie, but a more realistic one, who actually produces change in the world. 
                          Now let's get to what you actually have to do. The task is to write two letters. Both are addressed to you, or better said, an older version of you. One
                          should be for your 20-year old self, and the other, for your 30-year old self, respectively. You can write the letters by hand or using an online platform, 
                          like the one linked below. They can be however long and in whichever style you want, as long as you manage to transmit the message and some specific points clearly. 
                          You need to: 1. Ask yourself whether you have kept a Sustainable mindset throughout the years;
                                       2. Try to look back and identify the ways in which the situation around you has changed. Are people generally more sustainable?;
                                       3. Challenge yourself to identify ways in which you could become more sustainable after reading the letters.
                          That's it! It was great teching you and I really hope you enjoyed the course! Good luck having a fun, creative, and last, but not least, sustainable life!
