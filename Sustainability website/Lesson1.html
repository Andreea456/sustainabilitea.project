    <h1>THE ISSUE WITH PLASTIC USE</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="boxed">
    <h2>
        Plastic is a material that was created by humans. Its use has plummeted over the last century. There are many forms of plastic, each consisting of a unique polymer, and they are derived from oil. 
        They are widely used due to their many advantages. They are lightweight, cheaper than other materials, resistant, can be modelled in a wide range of shapes and sizes. All of these have made it become the most used material. It can be found everywhere around us. Sadly, its resistance to wear also makes it very long-lasting. Almost all of the plastic that has ever been made still exists on Earth today.
        Just to get an idea, these are approximations of the lifespan of some common items that we use: plastic water bottles - 450 years, disposable diapers - 500 years, extruded polystyrene foam - over 5,000 years.
    </h2>
    <h2>
        The industrial sectors that make use of plastic the most are the packaging one (141 million tonnes/year), the textiles one (42 million tonnes/year) and the consumer & institutional products (37 million tonnes).
    </h2>
    <h2>
        The plastic we use mostly ends up in landfills and in the ocean. They are currently contributing to the death of many sea animals and a decrease in the quality of life of people. Furthermore, it’s been discovered that, when in contact with other surfaces, tiny bits of plastics break from the main item, producing microplastics. These are very small particles (less than 2 mm) that contain toxic chemicals. Due to the fact that animals and humans tend to not see them, they have become part of our food chain. The long-term effects that this will have on our health is yet unknown.

        What can we do to prevent filling up Earth with so much plastic that it becomes harmful for both humans and other species?
    </h2>
    <h2>
        •	Firstly, by recycling responsibly! Before you separate your plastic items from your other refuse, check on them for a tiny triangle that has a number from 1 to 7 inside. That represents the type of plastic you are holding. Some types are easier to recycle (mostly types 1, 2, 5), and some may need to be taken to specialized locations (typically types 3, 4, 6, 7). However, you should always check what your local recycling centres can process.
    </h2>
    <h2>
        •	Secondly, you can always try to find plastic alternatives, such as using bamboo toothbrushes, taking fabric tote bags to the supermarket etc.
    </h2>
    <h2>
        •	Thirdly, you are always welcome to volunteer NGOs and movements that intend to solve the plastic problem

    Facts about plastic use:
    </h2>
    <h2>
    1.	Every square mile of ocean contains an average of 46,000 pieces of plastic, which choke and entangle sea birds and mammals
    </h2>
    <h2>
    2.	Plastic bags do not biodegrade; they break down into small pieces, eventually entering the food chain when eaten by animals 
    </h2>
    <h2>
    3.	On average we use a plastic bag for only 12 minutes before throwing it away
    </h2>
    <h2>
    4.	Reusing plastic is preferable to recycling as it uses less energy and fewer resources
    </h2>
    <h2>
    5.	Apart from that which has been incinerated, nearly every bit of plastic ever made still exists today 
    </h2> 
    <h2>
    6.	Making reusable and sustainable items a way of life is a very positive step towards a planet- friendly existence 
    </h2>
    <h2>
    7.	Each year, an estimated 500 billion to one trillion plastic bags are consumed worldwide
