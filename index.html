                Here, at Sustainabili-tea, we believe that everyone has the power to make the world a better
                place.
                Thus, working together might be the best solution to gradually reorganising what surrounds us
                such that we can shift to more eco friendly lifestyles.
                And what is the main element to take into account when we want to implement change? Well, 
                for us, staying educated is definetely it!

                This website provides an academic curriculum plan for a Sustainability class. "What? Did you say SCHOOL?"
                Yes, but don't close the browser so fast! Our course was designed in a fun, interactive way, 
                that presents some of today's biggest sustainability problems, the tea of our times. Classes are to be held monthly to allow 
                the students time to ponder on these issues, as well as try to come up with some solutions on their own, 
                while completing the craftsy, creativity-based tasks given to them.

            <h3>
                The main purpose after your take this class is that you then carry throughout your life all of the skills that you have developed, 
                as well as a sustainable way of looking at things.
