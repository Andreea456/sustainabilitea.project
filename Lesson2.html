        Look around you! What do you see (besides probably people)? Objects! Have you ever wondered where they come from 
        or have you just taken for granted their presence in the stores you got them from? 
    </h2>
    <h2>
        All of these have had to be designed in detail and created by someone. 
        But the process is actually way more complex, with a lot of people involved. 
        The interesting fact is that, despite what you might currently picture, those who think of a product, of what 
        it should look like or of what it should do are typically different from those who actually assemble your phones, 
        tablets, PSPs and sew your clothes. The latter tend to be factory workers from poorer backgrounds and they are 
        directly paid by big companies who send them designs of new items. 
    </h2>
    <h2>
        The issue arises when, after having asked these people to start working on a new project, 
        companies realize the said project might not be as much of a success 
        as they initially thought so they refuse to pay the workers.

        How did we get here?
    <br>
    <br>
        Well, it’s mostly due to capitalism, an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, 
        rather than by the state. Historically speaking, this has been the most efficient system that humans have come up with 
        until now, which has led to most countries living under it today. 
    </h2>
    <h2>
        It has been highly beneficial for a lot of people, 
        making the worldwide poverty rate drop from 94% in 1820 to 9.6% in 2015. 
    </h2>
    <h2>
        But if it is so efficient, why isn’t absolutely everyone living the dream? 
    <br>
        Like most aspects, this system has some major drawbacks and they are only getting worse as population increases. 
        For instance, companies getting away even without always paying those who work for them is one of the downsides.

        What could be some realistic solutions?
    <br>
    <br>
        No one has a final answer yet, but many are trying to switch to 
        a more sustainable lifestyle. They either produce their own objects, purchase them from local businesses or thrift them. 
        Now what you may ask is: “If I take a similar approach, how will I keep up with the new trends?”.
        It is indeed true that influencers and models around us have been promoting a phenomenon called 
        fast fashion – to remain cool we need to constantly buy the latest items developed by the companies we look up to. 
        This is also starting to be visible in electronics, with new phone/tablet models being released almost every year. 
        The need to always buy, even when unnecessary, is also a result of capitalism. Companies have managed, through campaigns and 
        commercials, to convince us that compulsive buying will make us feel happier.

    <h2>
        So how can we take action? 
    <br>
    <br>
        The most impactful way is to start looking for a balance between what we need and what we buy. Furthermore, we could do our best
        to find local companies producting what we need, instead of going to huge chains of stores.
